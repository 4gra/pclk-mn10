Advice for contributing: jut get in touch!

This is a sporadic hobby project for an abandoned piece of consumer electronics that (for all I know) nobody else on the planet even uses any more.  I'm more likely to spend time on specific things if I know someone else might stand to benefit, and I'm happy to help anyone who'd like to contribute / work out codes, which is the main bulk of the unfinished work as I see it.

You don't need to be familiar with Git or GitHub (I'm not!) and I promise I won't chastise you for not branching or doing pull requests "properly".  I will try to help anyone else with the same hardware to do their own decoding and tests, and would accept software changes to help with this process (on the other hand I won't be able to help with in-depth local setup if you're not comfortable with the basics, as it's likely to be too time-consuming).  Either way, you're welcome to ask.

Get in touch by filing an 'issue' against the project.
