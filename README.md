# pclk-mn10
(Attempting to) control the PCLK-MN10 USB device

This project doesn't contain much info, but it _can_ turn a hi-fi, connected appropriately to the device, on and off.
I intend to map as many functions of the link as is useful to me (and others, if they care to help) until I get bored.
I do not intend for this to become well-written software at any stage(!)

At the moment please see the [wiki](https://github.com/4gra/pclk-mn10/wiki) for more details / work in progress.
